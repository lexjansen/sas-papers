Run the programs in the programs folder in the following order:

- example1.sas
- example2.sas
- proc_lua.sas
- lua_json_cdisc_library_example.sas
- test_lua_json_libraries.sas

You may need to Change the global macro variable project_folder to point to your project folder.

The last 2 programs will extract a json file from the CDISC Library: json/sdtmct_20210625.json
This will onloy work after you replace the CDISC Library API token with your own personal token in the line:
  local token = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
