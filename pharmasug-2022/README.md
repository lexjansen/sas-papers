# PharmaSUG 2022

This repository contains all code and examples from the paper Working with Dataset-JSON using SASÂ©
Presented at PharmaSUG 2022, May 22 - 25

After the conference the code was updated because of the following reasons:

- the Dataset-JSON specification was updated to remove the fractionDigits attribute
- the code no longer creates a null value when a metadata attribute is missing
